# California_HousePricePrediction_InternseliteMajorProject
This project predicts house prices based on various property features using machine learning models like Linear Regression and Random Forest.

## Dataset
- **File**: `housing.csv`
- **Description**: Contains features such as the number of rooms, location, and age of the house.

## Key Steps
1. **Data Preparation**: Cleaned the dataset, handled missing values, and encoded categorical variables.
2. **Feature Scaling**: Standardized numerical features for model training.
3. **Modeling**: Implemented Linear Regression and Random Forest algorithms.
4. **Evaluation**: Assessed model accuracy with R² score and RMSE.

## Code
The complete code is available in `House_Price_Prediction.ipynb`.

## Results
The Random Forest model achieved an R² score of 0.826003(82%), making it a good fit for predicting housing prices.

## Requirements
- `pandas`
- `numpy`
- `matplotlib`
- `scikit-learn`
